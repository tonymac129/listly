## Fun Facts

 - I made this app because every coder created a very basic to-do app as their first beginner project, so I thought it would be cool to make a full-fledged to-do app with more advanced features such as adding tags or sorting/filtering tasks.
 - This is my first project where I actually wrote a whole readme markdown page to document it (the thing you're reading right now) 
 - Thanks for reading this readme and I hope you enjoy using Listly!
